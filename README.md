# How to Run the Notebook

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (see below).
3. Open 'Air_Fryer_Product_Reviews_Classification-Project.ipynb ' using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run each cell sequentially for:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model training (Basic NN(FNN), ANN, LSTM)
   - Evaluation & results

# Requirements & Dependencies

Install the following Python libraries:
   bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn torch

Or use the 'requirements.txt' if available.

# Models Used

- Basic Neural Network (Feedforward Neural Network)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM)
# Notes

- Dataset source: 'Air_Fryer_Reviews.csv'
- Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Confusion matrices included for each model.
