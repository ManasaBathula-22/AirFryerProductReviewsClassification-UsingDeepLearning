# Conclusion

Among the models tested:
- ANN and LSTM models has good accuracy of 91.78%(Approx).
- Choosing the model among them depends on the goal of the project.
- Since our goal is to correctly classify the reviews,LSTM model can be considered because it is better at handling sequential text data.
- Even though accuracy is same, ANN just works on fixed vectors, so it doesnâ€™t fully use sequential info.
